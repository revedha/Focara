Update the Focara landing page with the following changes. The goal is to make the value proposition more concrete, build trust with science-backed evidence, clarify the ethical pricing model, and create a stronger call-to-action to validate user commitment.

1. Update the "A Strong, Serious Approach to Digital Wellbeing" Section:

Modify the "Mindful Friction, Not Mindless Blocking" item.

New Headline: Mindful Friction, Not Mindless Blocking

New Body Copy: Focara intercepts mindless app-opening with a brief, engaging cognitive challenge—like a maze or a logic puzzle. This moment of active engagement breaks the habit loop in a way passive timers can't, empowering you to make a conscious choice.

2. Add a New Section: "Grounded in Science, Designed for Results"

Please add this new section after the "A Strong, Serious Approach" section.

Headline: Grounded in Science, Designed for Results

Body Copy: Focara is built on proven principles of behavioral psychology. We disrupt the brain's "Habit Loop" (Cue -> Routine -> Reward) by introducing 'Cognitive Friction'—a positive interruption that forces a moment of intentional thought. This scientifically-backed method helps weaken old neural pathways and build new, healthier ones.

3. Add a New Section: "Our Pricing & Philosophy"

Please add this new section after the "Grounded in Science" section.

Headline: A Model That Puts You First

Sub-headline: We succeed when you no longer need us. That's why we reject recurring subscriptions.

Display the following two pricing plans side-by-side:

Plan 1 Title: 3-Month Focus Pass

Plan 1 Price: $19.99

Plan 1 Description: A one-time payment for a dedicated, short-term transformation.

Plan 2 Title: 6-Month Habit-Building Pass (Most Popular)

Plan 2 Price: $29.99

Plan 2 Description: A one-time payment to solidify your new habits for life.

Trust Statement (below both plans): ✅ This is a one-time purchase, not a subscription.

4. Update the Final Call-to-Action Section:

Replace the current "Be the First to Take Control" section with the following:
